title: The nature buffer - the missing link in climate change and mental health research
---
The connections between climate change and mental health are well known. Research also points to the positive impacts of nature on mental health, well-being, and attention. However, no empirical research has examined how degradation of nature as a result of climate change can impact the mental health benefits that nature provides. This paper first reviews the existing research on the negative mental health consequences of climate change and the benefits of nature exposure for stress, mental health, and well-being. The connection between these two lines of research is examined in order to fully understand the impacts of climate change on mental health. Suggestions for future research are included.
